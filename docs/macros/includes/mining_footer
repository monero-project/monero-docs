## Efficiency

You may want to check your efficiency before you start mining. This is based on your power costs vs the hashrates that your hardware is able to produce.  
You can check your estimated hashrates at [xmrig.com/benchmark](https://xmrig.com/benchmark/).  
There are many sites, such as [CryptoCompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/xmr) that allow you to enter your hashrate, power draw and power costs to calculate your efficiency.
