## Requirements
### Wallet

Before starting, you'll need to have a Monero Wallet configured.    
It's highly recommended to create a new wallet for mining because wallet addresses are public on p2pool.    
You have to use the Primary wallet address for mining.    
_Subaddresses and integrated addresses are not supported._

### Node

P2Pool requires access to a properly configured Monero node. If you have a Monero node you will need to add the following to your monerod config file or startup flags

    --zmq-pub tcp://127.0.0.1:18083

**Example**

    ./monerod --zmq-pub tcp://127.0.0.1:18083 --out-peers 32 --in-peers 64 --add-priority-node=p2pmd.xmrvsbeast.com:18080 --add-priority-node=nodes.hashvault.pro:18080 --disable-dns-checkpoints --enable-dns-blocklist

If you do not run your own node, you can still mine on P2Pool by using a public ZMQ node.<br>An easy method is to use [Gupax](./gupax.md).


### XMRig and P2Pool

You'll need to download 2 pieces of software: XMRig & P2Pool.

- You can download XMRig from: [XMRig.com](https://xmrig.com/download)
- You can download P2Pool from: [P2Pool GitHub Repo](https://github.com/SChernykh/p2pool/releases/latest)

Note that you should check for, and update   your P2Pool software regularly.

## Configuring P2Pool

1. Open port `37889` for P2Pool "Main" or `37888` for P2Pool "Mini" in your firewall to ensure better connectivity (Optional)
2. Run `./p2pool --host NODE_IP_ADDRESS --rpc-port NODE_RPC_PORT --wallet PRIMARY_WALLET_ADDRESS`.

    - It's recommended that you use your own node. If that's the case `NODE_IP_ADDRESS` should be `127.0.0.1`.
    - Similarly, the `NODE_RPC_PORT` should be `18081` or `18089`.
    - `PRIMARY_WALLET_ADDRESS` **must** be your main address. Subaddresses are unsupported. <br>(Main addresses start with `4`, subaddresses start with `8`)
    - Add the flag `--mini` if youd prefer to mine on a lower difficulty P2Pool instance.

3. Wait for P2Pool to synchronize. It should take no more than 5-10 minutes.

See the [official docs](https://github.com/SChernykh/p2pool/blob/master/docs/COMMAND_LINE.MD) for more details about P2Pool.

## Running XMRig

On Linux and MacOS etc, run `./xmrig -o 127.0.0.1:3333` to start mining.
For higher hashrates on Windows, you'll need to edit properties to run as administrator. On Linux you'll run with `sudo`.

See the [official docs](https://xmrig.com/docs/miner/config) if youd prefer to use a config file.

## Efficiency

You may want to check your efficiency before you start mining. This is based on your power costs vs the hashrates that your hardware is able to produce.
You can check your estimated hashrates at [xmrig.com/benchmark](https://xmrig.com/benchmark/).
There are many sites, such as [CryptoCompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/xmr/) that allow you to enter your hashrate, power draw and power costs to calculate your efficiency.

## Getting Help

There is an active Monero mining community on Reddit at [/r/MoneroSupport](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneroSupport/). You can
