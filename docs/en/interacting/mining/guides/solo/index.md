# Solo Mining Monero

There are multiple ways to solo mine Monero.

- [Monero GUI](./monero-gui-solo.md)
- [Monero CLI](./cli-solo.md)
- [XMRig](./xmrig-solo.md)

Monero GUI and Monero CLI both use the monerod's (node) built in miner and is generally easier to use. GUI/CLI has no fees.

XMRig is an external miner. It is open source and mines with greater efficiency than monerod's built-in miner. XMRig has a fee of 1%.
