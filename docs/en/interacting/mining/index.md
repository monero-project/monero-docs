# Mining Monero

Monero is a Proof Of Work (**[POW](/proof-of-work/pow-in-cryptocurrencies.md)**) cryptocurrency.    
There are multiple ways to take part in mining Monero.

- [Solo Mining](./guides/solo/index.md)
- [Pool Mining](./guides/pool/xmrig-pool.md)
- [P2Pool Mining](./guides/p2pool/xmrig-p2pool.md)

Solo Mining is the purest, most decentralized and private form of mining, but requires the most patience.

Pool Mining is the most convenient form of mining, but it comes with centralization.

P2Pool Mining is decentralized and has the most frequent payouts, but has pool-like privacy and consolidations of payouts can be costly.
