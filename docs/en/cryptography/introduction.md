# Cryptography in Monero 

Monero uses a wide variety of cryptographic primitives for various use cases.

Comparing to altcoins, Monero cryptography is considered conservative, sound and robust.

Comparing to Bitcoin, Monero uses much more primitives, and some of them are more advanced, especially those related to privacy and Proof of Work.
Some choices are deliberately non-standard (for better or worse) - oftentimes a legacy of the CryptoNote protocol.
