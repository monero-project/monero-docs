"Base58 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme. It is similar to Base64 but has "
"been modified to avoid both non-alphanumeric characters and letters which "
"might look ambiguous when printed. The characters excluded in relation to "
"Base64 are: `IOl0+/`"

"Base58 does not strictly specify the format. This results in some "
